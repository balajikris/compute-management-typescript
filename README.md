# compute-management-typescript

This is a Typescript based sample that demonstrates how to programatically create and deploy a virtual machine in Azure using Azure SDK for Node.js.

**Note**: This sample requires a future version of azure packages (compute, storage, network) that is still work in progress.
See this [PR](https://github.com/Azure/autorest/pull/2084). Once this changed is merged and new versions of the packages are published to npm, just update the package versions in package.json to make this sample run.
